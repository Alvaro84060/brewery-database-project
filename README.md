# brewery-database-project
Brewery database project that includes basic information from staff, orders, payments, products, customers.

In this first stage, I set up the tables I will need for this project. As you will see, I included essential 
tables of any commerce, such as employees and their roles, products, customers, payment methods, orders, etc. 
As I continue advancing with the project (and hopefully my knowledge too hehe) I will add more tables, for example 
to be able to keep track of stock and suppliers and to be able to perform more complex queries with more specific results.

The software I used to create the ER Diagram was drawsql.app.
